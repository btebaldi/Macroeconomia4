% Let alpha = alpha(0), alpha(1), ...., alpha(r),
% where alphai is n by n, for i=0,1,...,r.
% this routine finds an n by n matrix root, A, of the polynomial
% alpha(0)*(A^r)) + alpha(1)*(A^(r-1)) + ... + alpha(r) = 0
% 
% Remark #1: Note that hmat = [alpha(r), ..., alpha(0)];
%
% Also, modified 13/1 2003 to report ErrFlagVal equal to 0 if solution is ok, 1 if not.
